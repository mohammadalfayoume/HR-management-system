## What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?

Actuly I have learned how to creat objects in assignment 8 for seven employees, and there was a lot of repeating things, so I wrote a lot of code lines.

but in assignment 9 I learned how to create a constructor as a blueprint template and take a copy from it for each employee, so I shourtcut a lot of lines of code and easiest.

## How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

it took about two houres and I expected it will take more than.
